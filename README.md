# warbler

Warbler is a Python-based Twitter clone built using Flask and SQLAlchemy.

Most of the code here was provided for us by the instructors at Rithm School, but my partner and I implemented bug fixes to the logout, user profile, use card, profile edit, and homepage routes/functionality. And we created the tests.

SQLAlchemy
PostgreSQL
